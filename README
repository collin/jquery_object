A simple object cloner wrapped in jQuery to get to true prototypal inheritance.

Took it from the man himself, Douglas Crockford.

Try it out like this:

Named = _.clone({
  inspect: function() {alert(this.name);}
  name: "Provide a name!"
});

Named.clone({name: "Felix"}).inspect();

It's about that simple.
